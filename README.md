# flowerplot

**flowerplot** is a hybrid python-c++ package for verifying the reparameterization property of the general Markov model according to which it is possible to obtain the same log-likelihood score at any location of the root given a topology. Visualization of the reparameterization property using the experimental phylogenetic topology and DNA sequences generated by Randall and colleagues is the emphasis of this package.

The main functions made available are 

1. Expectation-Maximization (EM) for the Barry-Hartigan model (GMM) for a fixed topology with parsimony states used to initialize parameters. Methodology is described in the following preprint.

2. Given a GMM defined on a topology rooted at some node, start EM at alternate internal nodes of topology using reparameterized GMM. Methodology is described in the following paper

3. Generate flower plots visualizing change in log likelihood score, with each petal representing GMM's root location:

a) Log likelihood obtained using initial parameters, and final parameters after convergence of EM.
b) Expected complete-data log likelihood computed after first and final iteration of EM
